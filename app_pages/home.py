This site has been created to host and showcase a number of smaller web-apps &mdash; 
apps where a stand-alone app would be overkill &mdash; while larger apps have dedicated deployments.
These smaller apps have largely been created as a way to practice coding, try new 
technologies or test new ideas &mdash; even this site was partly to test making multipage apps in Streamlit.       

I am both a data nerd and keen cyclist &mdash; spending a lot of time riding and racing on the virtual roads 
of Zwift &mdash; so a lot of my projects combine these two worlds. Check out some of my larger projects below
and smaller apps in the navigation menu (‚Üê over there!)'''
